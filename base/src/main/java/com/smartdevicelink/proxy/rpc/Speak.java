/**
 * Speaks a phrase over the vehicle audio system using SDL's TTS
 * (text-to-speech) engine. The provided text to be spoken can be simply a text
 * phrase, or it can consist of phoneme specifications to direct SDL's TTS
 * engine to speak a "speech-sculpted" phrase
 * <p></p>
 * Receipt of the Response indicates the completion of the Speak operation,
 * regardless of how the Speak operation may have completed (i.e. successfully,
 * interrupted, terminated, etc.)
 * <p></p>
 * Requesting a new Speak operation while the application has another Speak
 * operation already in progress (i.e. no corresponding Response for that
 * in-progress Speak operation has been received yet) will terminate the
 * in-progress Speak operation (causing its corresponding Response to be sent by
 * SDL) and begin the requested Speak operation

 * Requesting a new Speak operation while the application has an <i>
 * {@linkplain Alert}</i> operation already in progress (i.e. no corresponding
 * Response for that in-progress <i>{@linkplain Alert}</i> operation has been
 * received yet) will result in the Speak operation request being rejected
 * (indicated in the Response to the Request)
 * <p></p>
 * Requesting a new <i>{@linkplain Alert}</i> operation while the application
 * has a Speak operation already in progress (i.e. no corresponding Response for
 * that in-progress Speak operation has been received yet) will terminate the
 * in-progress Speak operation (causing its corresponding Response to be sent by
 * SDL) and begin the requested <i>{@linkplain Alert}</i> operation
 * <p></p>
 * Requesting a new Speak operation while the application has a <i>
 * {@linkplain PerformInteraction}</i> operation already in progress (i.e. no
 * corresponding Response for that in-progress <i>
 * {@linkplain PerformInteraction}</i> operation has been received yet) will
