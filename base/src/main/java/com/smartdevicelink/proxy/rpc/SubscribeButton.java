/**
 *<p> Establishes a subscription to button notifications for HMI buttons. Buttons
 * are not necessarily physical buttons, but can also be "soft" buttons on a
 * touch screen, depending on the display in the vehicle. Once subscribed to a
 * particular button, an application will receive both
 * {@linkplain OnButtonEvent} and {@linkplain OnButtonPress} notifications
 * whenever that button is pressed. The application may also unsubscribe from
 * notifications for a button by invoking the {@linkplain UnsubscribeButton}
 * operation</p>
 * 
 * <p>When a button is depressed, an {@linkplain OnButtonEvent} notification is
 * sent to the application with a ButtonEventMode of BUTTONDOWN. When that same
 * button is released, an {@linkplain OnButtonEvent} notification is sent to the
 * application with a ButtonEventMode of BUTTONUP</p>
 * 
 * <p>When the duration of a button depression (that is, time between depression
 * and release) is less than two seconds, an {@linkplain OnButtonPress}
 * notification is sent to the application (at the moment the button is
 * released) with a ButtonPressMode of SHORT. When the duration is two or more
 * seconds, an {@linkplain OnButtonPress} notification is sent to the
 * application (at the moment the two seconds have elapsed) with a
 * ButtonPressMode of LONG</p>
 * 
 * The purpose of {@linkplain OnButtonPress} notifications is to allow for
 * programmatic detection of long button presses similar to those used to store
 * presets while listening to the radio, for example
 * 
 * <p>When a button is depressed and released, the sequence in which notifications
 * will be sent to the application is as follows:</p>
 * 
 * <p>For short presses:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>OnButtonEvent (ButtonEventMode = BUTTONDOWN)</li>
 * <li>OnButtonEvent (ButtonEventMode = BUTTONUP)</li>
 * <li>OnButtonPress (ButtonPressMode = SHORT)</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>For long presses:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>OnButtonEvent (ButtonEventMode = BUTTONDOWN)</li>
 * <li>OnButtonEvent (ButtonEventMode = BUTTONUP)</li>
 * <li>OnButtonPress (ButtonPressMode = LONG)</li>
 * </ul>
